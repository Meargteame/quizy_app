### What's Fixed:
1. **Proper line breaks**: The command sequences are now clearly separated with markdown code blocks and headings.
2. **Markdown syntax**: Ensured proper use of syntax for commands and code blocks.
3. **Structure**: Improved the flow for easier readability and added appropriate space between different sections.
